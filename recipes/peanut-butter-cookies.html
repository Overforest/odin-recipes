            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth; beat in eggs.</li><br>
            <li>Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture until dough is just combined. Chill cookie dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour to make it easier to work with.</li><br>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball with a fork, making a crisscross pattern.</li><br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 7 to 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li><br>
